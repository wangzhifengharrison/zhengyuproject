    <p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: justify;">
      Ryan completed his undergraduate degree in Nanotechnology at the University of Leeds, before joining the Cavendish
      Laboratory as an EPSRC CDT (NanoDTC) student in 2014, and DiMicheleLAB as a PhD student in 2015. He completed his
      PhD in 2018 and remained in the lab as a postdoc. Ryan focuses on the development of a new class of DNA-based
      nanostructures for the self-assembly of functional nanostructured crystalline frameworks.
